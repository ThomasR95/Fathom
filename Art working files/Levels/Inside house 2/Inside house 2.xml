        <!-- Why am I so different? 
I can't even talk to people properly, apparently I am supposed to look people in the eye, but I just can't do it. Maybe that's why I can't make friends? It's not that I don't want to, I would love to have someone else who is close to me I can play with and talk to, but it's just so hard.
I know there are other kids who are shy like me, but even they seem to be able to talk to other people. I am happy on my own too, but sometimes I think I would just love someone else to speak to. 
David at school said I must be an alien, cause I don't behave normal like everyone else, but I don't know if he's being serious or what. I don't understand 'sarcasm'. If people say something but mean something else -- what is the point? Why not just say what you mean?! People confuse me. 
Anyway, mum says she's booked an appointment to see someone about my behaviour. I guess I'll see what happens, maybe they can tell me if I'm from this planet or not.
Either way, at least I always have the animals, they don't care that I'm different.
