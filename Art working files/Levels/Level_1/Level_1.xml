That girl looked like she knew something about this place, and looked distressed too.
I get the feeling I'm here for... a purpose. Whatever that may be, I need to find out. "/>

        <!-- I'm so glad I always have this place to myself! It's always so peaceful and quiet here, like my own tiny slice of forest just for me. 
As is usual when I write my feelings down, I feel myself questioning if there's something seriously wrong with me. The world around me seems to find excitement and joy out of the loudest of places and things, but I find only pain and misery. 
It's not even just the typical things, like booming music or a screaming baby - although those bother me too. Everytime I hear an airplane overhead or an ambulance passing by, I have to clutch my head, try and claw the noise out, sometimes I even have to run away because these noises create pictures of horrible monsters in my head that just want to see me dead - it's hard to even put into words how it makes me feel. 
I'm not even safe at home, I hate the sounds the vacuum makes when mum cleans, I always scream at her to stop or maybe to warn me first but she always says I'm being stupid and overreacting. And maybe I am... I just don't know what to do... 
So, anyway, that's why I like it here. I have only the soft chirping of the birds to keep me company, and their chatting doesn't offend my ears, it feels like they are comforting me.
