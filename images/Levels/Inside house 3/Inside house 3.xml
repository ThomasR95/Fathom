        <!-- I haven't decided if I like this place or not yet. 
It's smaller than our old house for sure, but I like that its not in a loud, stupid city - instead I've got all this nice woods and stuff around me. It's not far from the old place, so I still go to my old school and stuff (wish I didn't have to) but the new surroundings are still a lot to get used to.
I guess it didn't help that the move was a huge shock to me, I only found out about it a few weeks before it happened and, well, wasn't happy about it. I'm still not. 
I also have to share with mum and dad... Yay. But at least they let me build a blanket fort. They even got me some lovely soft pillows which was nice. 
The new place is really small, which I would be fine with, but I hate that I almost have no time to myself now. Mum seems more clingy than usual now, maybe it has something to do with my diagnosis or moving?
I don't really know, I just feel like I'm going to burst if I don't have any time to myself for much longer. And they wonder why I spend all my time in the shed or in the forest clearing near the park.
